This google colab has been adjusted to perform a simple molecular dynamics (MD) of the OpenMM - Simple-Simulate-Complex developed by Tim Dudgeon and John Chodera (https://github.com/tdudgeon/simple-simulate-complex) with Mg2+-dependent metalloproteins. In this case, some parameters have been adjusted so that an Mg2+ dummy is recognized that is capable of performing octahedral coordination during the MD and maintaining an orientation that is closer to what is expected biologically (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00286).
